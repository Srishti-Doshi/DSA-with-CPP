// Question1: WAP to find the Factorial of a number entered by the user. Hint: factorial of a number(n) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)*......* 1 and exists for positive numbers only. We write factorial as n! So, factorial of 0! = 1, 1!=1, 2!=2, 3!=6, 4!=24 and so on.Note- Please do not confuse factorial with NOTE QUAL TO operator, they are not the same

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n;
    cout<<"Enter a number: ";
    cin>>n;
    int fact = 1;

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        fact = fact * i;
    }

    cout<<"factorial of n: "<<fact;
    return 0;
}
